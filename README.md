# MTE - 2D Game Engine

## Introduction

MTE is a 2D game engine project that is currently under development. The goal of this project is to provide a simple and flexible environment for creating 2D games, as well as to establish a solid foundation for various features. The engine is a work in progress, and it is incomplete at the moment.

## Features

- **Logging System:** The engine includes a logging system to facilitate debugging and monitoring. This allows developers to track and analyze events, making the development process smoother.

- **Event System:** A robust event system is being implemented to handle various in-game events efficiently. This system aims to provide a flexible mechanism for managing interactions within the game.

- **Layers System:** The Layers System in MTE provides a powerful organizational structure for handling various elements within your 2D game. Layers are a fundamental concept in game development, offering a flexible way to manage the rendering order and interactions between different components.

- **ImGui Integration:** MTE seamlessly integrates ImGui, a popular GUI toolkit, to provide developers with an easy-to-use interface for tweaking parameters, inspecting variables, and debugging their games.

- **Glad (OpenGL):** MTE utilizes Glad, a library for loading OpenGL functions, to ensure compatibility and efficient rendering on a variety of systems. This allows developers to take full advantage of OpenGL capabilities in their 2D game projects.
